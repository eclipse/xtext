# The Build Infrastructure of Xtext

Xtext uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) to build the Java projects that are independent of Eclipse, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) to build the Maven plug-ins, and [Tycho](https://eclipse.org/tycho/) to build the Eclipse plug-ins. The builds are executed on a [Jenkins server](http://services.typefox.io/open-source/jenkins/).

An overview of the project dependencies and their build systems is shown here:

The Gradle projects marked with `*` include generated Tycho builds for creating p2 repositories as described below. For `xtext-xtend`, only the Tycho build depends on `xtext-eclipse`, while the Gradle and Maven builds just require `xtext-extras`.

## The Build Systems

### Gradle

The projects that include Gradle builds are `xtext-lib`, `xtext-core`, `xtext-extras`, `xtext-web`, and `xtext-xtend`. These repositories share some common concepts:

* `settings.gradle` in the project root lists the subprojects to be included in the build.
* `build.gradle` in the project root applies commonly used plugin-ins such as `java` and applies configuration scripts from the `gradle` directory to all subprojects. The intent of each configuration script is explained in a file header comment.
* Each subproject has its own `build.gradle` that declares a title, description, and dependencies.
* The project version as well the versions of common dependencies are declared in `versions.gradle`.
* The remote repositories from which dependencies are drawn are declared in `upstream-repositories.gradle`. Depending on the `useJenkinsSnapshots` property, dependencies to upstream Xtext projects are resolved either against the Maven repositories created by [Jenkins build jobs](#the-build-servers) or against [public snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).
* The [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) code is compiled with the [xtext-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/xtext/xtext-gradle-plugin). Since this plug-in has dependencies to projects that we want to compile, we have a bootstrap problem, which is solved using a shared dependency configuration declared in the root project (see `bootstrap-setup.gradle`). For `xtext-web` the Java code generated by Xtend is not tracked in the git repository. For the other repositories the generated code is tracked in order to verify changes to the compiler. Here the compiler is activated with the `compileXtend` property.
* All build artifacts are installed into a local Maven repository `build/maven-repository` (see `maven-deployment.gradle`). The `pom.xml` files are generated with the `maven` Gradle plug-in.
* The Gradle projects `xtext-lib`, `xtext-core`, `xtext-extras`, and `xtext-xtend` are published both as Maven artifacts and as Eclipse plug-ins. Here the `MANIFEST.MF` files are maintained manually, which means they need to be kept consistent with the `build.gradle` configuration. The build timestamp is inserted into the version qualifier of these manifests automatically (see `manifest-gen.gradle`). For the generated source bundles, the manifest is completely generated from the project metadata. The `xtext-web` project is not published for Eclipse, but here we generate OSGi-compatible manifests using the `osgi` Gradle plug-in.
* The builds of `xtext-lib`, `xtext-core`, and `xtext-extras` include a Gradle plug-in that can generate a second Tycho-based build into the `releng` directory by running `./gradlew generateP2Build` (see `p2-deployment.gradle`). This Tycho build creates a local p2 repository in `build/p2-repository`. This approach eliminates the need to manually keep these Tycho builds consistent with the Gradle builds, e.g. regarding version numbers.
* The Xtext generator can be invoked from Gradle for the languages contained in the Xtext projects (see `mwe2-workflows.gradle`). For example, test languages can be generated with `./gradlew generateTestLanguages`.

### Maven Plug-ins

Maven plug-ins are built by the `xtext-maven` project and by the `org.eclipse.xtend.maven.*` subprojects in `xtext-xtend`.

* The root `pom.xml` (in `xtext-xtend` it's named `maven-pom.xml`) lists the subprojects to be included in the build.
* The parent modules `org.eclipse.xtext.maven.parent` and `org.eclipse.xtend.maven.parent` define the common plug-in configuration and metadata.
* Depending on the chosen profile, dependencies to upstream Xtext projects are resolved either against the Maven repositories created by [Jenkins build jobs](#the-build-servers) (`useJenkinsSnapshots` profile) or against [public snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots) (`useSonatypeSnapshots` profile).
* The `deploy` goal installs the artifacts into a local Maven repository `build/maven-repository`.

### Tycho

The Eclipse plug-ins and features of `xtext-eclipse` and `xtext-xtend` are built with Tycho.

* The root `pom.xml` (in `xtext-xtend` it's named `tycho-pom.xml`) lists the subprojects to be included in the build.
* The parent modules `org.eclipse.xtext.tycho.parent` and `org.eclipse.xtend.tycho.parent` define the common plug-in configuration.
* The target platform modules `org.eclipse.xtext.target` and `org.eclipse.xtend.target` define from where to fetch the dependencies. This includes external dependencies such as EMF as well as upstream Xtext projects, which are referenced via the p2 repositories created by [Jenkins build jobs](#the-build-servers).
* The modules `org.eclipse.xtext.p2-repository` and `org.eclipse.xtend.p2-repository` list the plug-ins and features to be exported. The resulting p2 repositories are copied to `build/p2-repository`.
* The [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) code is compiled with the [xtend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/tree/master/org.eclipse.xtend.maven.plugin).

Another Tycho build is found in `xtext-umbrella`, with a very similar structure as described above. The difference is that the umbrella does not build its own plug-ins, but fetches all plug-ins from the other projects, builds some cross-project features (Xtext and Xtend SDKs), and exports them to a common p2 repository. The resulting p2 repository is used to create the Xtext update site for Eclipse.

## The Build Servers

### Jenkins

Each project has its own [multibranch pipeline](https://jenkins.io/blog/2015/12/03/pipeline-as-code-with-multibranch-workflows-in-jenkins/) on the [Jenkins build server](http://services.typefox.io/open-source/jenkins/). The server polls the git repositories every few minutes and automatically refreshes its build jobs: a new job is created for each new branch that is found, and the jobs of branches that do not exist anymore are deleted. This approach gives committers a very convenient way to test their changes on the server without affecting the main development streams (master and maintenance branches).

The actual build job description is written in a [Jenkinsfile](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/). This file is included in the git repositories and thus can be modified per branch. Basically it defines the commands to execute for each build, where to find test results, and which artifacts to make available.

The build artifacts of each project are made available as a Maven repository, a p2 repository, or both. The build jobs of downstream projects are configured to consume the build artifacts of the projects they depend on. Gradle and Maven plug-in builds pick up their dependencies from the Maven repositories generated for their upstream projects, while Tycho builds use the p2 repositories.

### Jenkins

The actual publishing is done on a [Jenkins build server](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext) by two build jobs: [xtext-snapshots](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/xtext-snapshots/) for nightly snapshots and [xtext-release](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/xtext/job/xtext-release/) for milestones and releases. Both employ the [publishing](https://github.com/TypeFox/publishing) project, which does the following:

1. Download Maven artifacts with a specified version from the repositories that are made available by the various Jenkins build jobs as described above.
2. [Sign the jar files](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JAR_Signing) with the remote service of the Eclipse Foundation.
3. Create additional signature files for publishing to remote Maven repositories.
4. Upload the results either to a snapshot repository or to a staging repository.
5. Download the common p2 repository from the Jenkins build job of `xtext-umbrella` as a zip file and unzip it.
6. Sign the jar files that have not already been signed in step 2 (results of the signing service are reused if the input files are equal).
7. Copy the signed jars and p2 repository metadata to the `build-result` directory and zip it.
8. Generate ant scripts for deploying the p2 repository to the Eclipse public download area (this might be improved in the future).

## The Release Process

#### Overview of the Process

1. Development phase
   1. Work on new features and issues.
   2. [Publish milestones](#preparing-milestones-and-releases) as required, e.g. when important new features have been implemented.
2. Release phase
   1. Stop implementing new features, but work on bug fixes.
   2. Create a release branch and [publish release candidate milestones](#preparing-milestones-and-releases) if required.
   3. [Lift the version number](#lifting-the-version-number) on the `master` branch and start the development phase for the next major/minor release (in parallel to the following steps).
   4. Create a test plan and test both old and new features.
   5. Prepare release notes.
   6. Merge or cherry-pick the bug fixes between the `master` branch and the release branch.
   7. [Publish the release](#preparing-milestones-and-releases).
   8. Create and push git tags.
   9. [Close the GitHub milestone](#github-milestones) and create new milestones.
3. Maintenance phase
   1. Work on bug fixes on the `master` branch.
   2. When it appears appropriate, create a service release branch and cherry-pick the bug fixes.
   3. [Publish a service release](#preparing-milestones-and-releases).
   4. Create and push git tags.
   5. If necessary, repeat the maintenance phase.

When major or minor releases are done, there should be a time period of at least one week when only important fixes are added to the code base to be released. This can be achieved by creating the release branch and committing the fixes directly to that branch. The release branch is merged back into `master` just before the actual release is done so the fixes are available there, too.

### Preparing Milestones and Releases

To initiate a release build start the build job [release-prepare-branches](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/release-prepare-branches/). This job automates the process to a large degree. Once it is triggered it takes about 4-5 hours to complete. If you are interested in the details, read the section "What happens when the _release-prepare-branches_ job is executed".

After everything above has run smoothly, it is finally time for some manual steps again. We will try to integrate some of them into the automated release pipeline from time to time.

1. Check that everything was promoted correctly:
   * [Xtext Downloads Page](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/downloads/) should list the new release
   * Milestone / Release Candidate Builds will be listed in _Stable Builds_, Release Builds below _Latest Releases_ (might need to expand other releases)
2. Promote staged release on [oss.sonatype.org](https://oss.sonatype.org). Can only be done by Xtext release engineer (@kthoms, @spoenemann, @Hejado)
   * Log in with user 'xtext.team'.
   * Select _Staging Repositories_
   * Search for _orgeclipsextext-NNNN_ and _orgeclipsextend-NNNN_ with status _open_
   * Select both and perform the _Close_ toolbar action
   * Wait until the checks have run successfully
   * Select both repositories again the perform the _Release_ toolbar action
   * It will take some hours until the artifacts are mirrored to Maven Central.
3. Contribute release to [Simrel Aggregation Build](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Simrel/Contributing_to_Simrel_Aggregation_Build)
   * Merge the [open Gerrit change](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/project:simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build+owner:xtext-bot%2540eclipse.org+status:open) for the `simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build` repository
4. Publish websites (Only on final release)
   * Remove `published: false` from release post
   * [Create PR](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/compare/website-published...website-master?expand=1) to merge branch `website-master` into `website-published`
5. Update Marketplace entries (Only on final release)
   * Market place entry for [Xtext](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-xtext/edit)
   * Market place entry for [Xtend](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-xtend/edit)
   * For each update the properties:
     * Version Number
     * Update Site URL
     * Supported Eclipse Release(s)
6. As soon as Maven Central is updated - send notifications
   * Newsgroup / Forum
   * Mailing list
   * Gitter
   * Twitter
   * Blog (for releases)
7. Add / Update xtext-reference-projects (Only on final release)
8. Adjust the bootstrap version to use the newly produced milestone / release
    * Run the [bot-updates job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/bot-updates/)
    * Use `XTEXT_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION` for the `UPDATE_TYPE` parameter
9.  xtext-apidiff (Only on final release)
    * adapt https://github.com/xtext/xtext-apidiff/blob/master/create-api-diff.sh
    * adapt Jenkins Configuration https://github.com/xtext/xtext-apidiff/blob/master/Jenkinsfile


#### What happens when the _release-prepare-branches_ job is executed

Read this section when you are interested in some details about the steps that are performed when triggering the [release-prepare-branches job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/release-prepare-branches/). The job will perform the following:

1. Check out a clean copy of all Xtext repositories
2. Create branches for the release on all repositories (`milestone_«version»` for milestones, and `release_«version»` for releases)
3. Adjust target platforms and pom.xml files to fetch from upstream job builds
4. Set the Xtext version into `gradle/versions.gradle` files
5. Set the Xtext version into `version` property of `pom.xml` files where needed
6. Commit all changes
7. Tag the commit with the tag name `v«version»`
8. Push the release branches

When the job finishes, all release branches are prepared. Now Jenkins will pick up the new branches and initiate builds for all repositories. Note that the first build for all jobs except for `xtext-lib` will fail then, since the downstream jobs won't find the required artifacts from a successful upstream build at that time. But the jobs will trigger their downstream jobs automatically. So when `xtext-lib` was successful, it will trigger `xtext-core`, which triggers `xtext-extras` on success and so on. It will take some hours until the last build, `xtext-umbrella` is triggered for the release build. Usually this is just a matter of waiting, but keep an eye on the builds. A build might fail due to a flaky test, or a missed performance goal in a test. Then just re-trigger the build.

Finally, when `xtext-umbrella` was build successfully, all release artifacts were build and they are ready for publishing. The `xtext-umbrella` job will now trigger the [sign-and-deploy job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/sign-and-deploy/) with the appropriate parameters. This will do:

1. Sign all artifacts with Eclipse Signing Service (for p2 artifacts) and with GPG (for Maven artifacts)
2. Upload all artifacts to [OSSRH](https://oss.sonatype.org/)
3. Deploy the p2 repository to the [Xtext Downloads](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/downloads/) location on the project storage
4. Unzip the repository to its location on the p2 update site location (directory below the composite site location)
5. Update the p2 composite site descriptors
6. Trigger an update of the SimRel repository contribution with the [release-simrel-update job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/release-simrel-update/)
7. For the final release: Trigger lifting of the Xtext version to the next minor release version in the projects and raise Pull Requests for the update. This is done with the [bot-updates job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/bot-updates/).


### Lifting the Version Number

Lifting the version number is performed with the [bot-updates job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/bot-updates/). Choose the option `XTEXT_VERSION` for parameter `UPDATE_TYPE` and enter the version in for parameter `UPDATE_VALUE`.

When performing a release this will be automatically triggered by the [sign-and-deploy job](https://ci.eclipse.org/xtext/job/releng/job/sign-and-deploy/) and increment the current version from the `master` branch to the next minor version.

For bugfix or major releases the job has to be triggered manually.

### GitHub Milestones

We use GitHub milestones to communicate when bug fixes and new features will be available and to generate a list of resolved issues for the release notes. When a major or minor release is done, the corresponding GitHub milestone should be closed. If there are open issues left in that milestone, they should be removed from it or assigned to another milestone.
