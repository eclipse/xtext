<p>Xtext provides you with a set of domain-specific languages and modern APIs to describe the different 
				aspects of your programming language. 
				Based on that information it gives you a full implementation of that language running on the JVM. 
				The compiler components of your language are independent of Eclipse or OSGi and can be used in any Java environment.
				They include such things as the parser, the type-safe abstract syntax tree (AST), the serializer and 
				code formatter, the scoping framework and the linking, compiler checks and static analysis aka validation 
				and last but not least a code generator or interpreter. These runtime components integrate with and 
				are based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which effectively allows you to 
				use Xtext together with other EMF frameworks like for instance the Graphical Modeling Project GMF.</p>
<p>In addition to this nice runtime architecture, you will get a full blown Eclipse-IDE specifically tailored 
				for your language. It already provides great default functionality for 
				all aspects and again comes with DSLs and APIs that allow to configure or change the most common things 
				very easily. And if that&rsquo;s not flexible enough there is Guice to replace the default behaviour with
				your own implementations.</p>
