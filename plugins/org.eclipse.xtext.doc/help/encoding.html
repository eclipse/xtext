<p>
				
<span class="emphasis"><em>Encoding</em></span>, AKA 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>character set</em></span>, describes the way characters are encoded into bytes and vice versa. 
				Famous standard encodings are &ldquo;UTF-8&rdquo; or &ldquo;ISO-8859-1&rdquo;. The list of available encodings can be determined
				by calling 
				<code class="code">java.nio.Charset.availableCharsets()</code>. There is also a list of encodings and their 
				canonical Java names in the 
				<a class="ulink" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html" target="_new">API docs</a>.
			</p>
<p>Unfortunately, each platform and/or spoken language tends to define its own native encoding, 
				e.g. 
				<code class="code">Cp1258</code> on Windows in Vietnamese or 
				<code class="code">MacIceland</code> on Mac OS X in Icelandic. 
			</p>
<p>In an Eclipse workspace, files, folders, projects can have individual encodings, which are stored
				in the file 
				<code class="code">.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs</code> in each project. If a resource does not have an 
				explicit encoding, it inherits the one from its parent recursively. Eclipse chooses the native
				platform encoding as the default for the workspace root. You can change the default workspace 
				encoding in the Eclipse preferences 
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Preferences-&gt;Workspace-&gt;Default text encoding</em></span>. If you develop on
				different platforms, you should consider choosing an explicit common encoding for your text or code
				files, especially if you use special characters. 
			</p>
<p>While Eclipse allows to define and inspect the encoding of a file, your file system usually doesn&rsquo;t. 
				Given an arbitrary text file there is no general strategy to tell how it was encoded. If you deploy 
				an Eclipse project as a jar (even a plug-in), any encoding information not stored in the file itself 
				is lost, too. Some languages define the encoding of a file explicitly, as in the first processing 
				instruction of an XML file. Most languages don&rsquo;t. Others imply a fixed encoding or offer enhanced 
				syntax for character literals, e.g. 
				<code class="code">\uXXXX</code> in Java. 
			</p>
<p>As Xtext is about textual modeling, it allows to tweak the encoding in various places.</p>

<p>The plug-ins created by the 
					<span class="emphasis"><em>New Xtext Project</em></span> wizard are by default encoded in the workspace&rsquo;s standard
					encoding. The same holds for all files that Xtext generates in there.
					If you want to change that, e.g. because your grammar uses/allows special characters, you should manually 
					set the encoding in the properties of these projects after their creation. Do this before 
					adding special characters to your grammar or at least make sure the grammar reads correctly after the 
					encoding change. To tell the Xtext generator to generate files in the same encoding, set the encoding 
					property in the workflow next to your grammar, e.g.
				</p>
<div class="literallayout">
<p>
<code class="code">Generator&nbsp;{<br>
	encoding&nbsp;="UTF-8"<br>
	...<br>

<p>As each language could handle the encoding problem differently, Xtext offers a service here. 
					The ${org.eclipse.xtext/src/org/eclipse/xtext/parser/IEncodingProvider} has a single method 

					<code class="code">getEncoding(URI)</code> to define the encoding of the resource with the given URI. Users can implement 
					their own strategy but keep in mind that this is not intended to be a long running method. If the 
					encoding is stored within the model file itself, it should be extractable in an easy way, like from 
					then first line in an XML file. The default implementation returns the default Java character set 
					in the runtime scenario. 
				</p>
<p>In the UI scenario, when there is a workspace, users will expect the encoding of the model files 
					to be settable the same way as for other files in the workspace. The default implementation 
					of the 
					<code class="code">IEncodingProvider</code> in the UI scenario Xtext therefore returns the file&rsquo;s workspace encoding 
					for files in the workspace and delegates to the runtime implementation for all other resources, 
					e.g. models in a jar or from a deployed plug-in. Keep in mind that you are going to loose the 
					workspace encoding information as soon as you leave this workspace, e.g. deploy your project.
				</p>
<p>Unless you want to enforce a uniform encoding for all models of your language, we advise to 
					override the runtime service only. It is bound in the runtime module using the binding annotation 

					<code class="code">Runtime</code>. For the uniform encoding, bind the plain 
					<code class="code">IEncodingProvider</code> to the same implementation 
					in both modules.

<p>An ${org.eclipse.xtext/src/org/eclipse/xtext/resource/XtextResource} uses the 
					<code class="code">IEncodingProvider</code> 
					of your language by default. You can override that by passing an option on load and save, e.g.
				</p>
<div class="literallayout">
<p>
<code class="code">Map&lt;?,?&gt;&nbsp;options&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;HashMap();<br>
options.put(XtextResource.OPTION_ENCODING,&nbsp;"UTF-8");<br>
myXtextResource.load(options);<br>
options.put(XtextResource.OPTION_ENCODING,&nbsp;"ISO-8859-1");<br>
myXtextResource.save(options);<br>

<p>The ${org.eclipse.xtext.generator/src/org/eclipse/xtext/ui/generator/projectWizard/SimpleProjectWizardFragment} 
					generates a wizard that clients of your language can use to create model 
					projects. This wizard expects its templates to be in the encoding of the Generator that created it 
					(see above). As every new project wizard, its output will be encoded in the default encoding of the 
					target workspace. </p>

<p>The source code of the Xtext framework itself is completely encoded in &ldquo;ISO 8859-1&rdquo;, which is necessary 
					to make the Xpand templates work everywhere (they use french quotation markup). That encoding is hard 
					coded into the Xtext generator code. You are likely never going to change that. </p>
