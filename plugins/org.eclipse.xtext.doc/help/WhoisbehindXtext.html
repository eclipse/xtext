<p>Xtext is a professional Open-Source project. We, the main developers and the project lead, work for 
				itemis, 
				which is a well known consulting company specialized on model-based development.
				Therefore we are able to work almost full-time on the project. Xtext is an Eclipse.org project. 
				Besides many other advantages this means that you don&rsquo;t have to fear any IP issues, because the Eclipse Foundation 
				has their own lawyers who take care that no intellectual property is violated. </p>
<p>You may ask: Where does the money for Open-Source development come from? Well, we provide professional 
				services around Xtext. Be it training or on-site consulting, be it development of prototypes or 
				implementation of full-blown IDEs for programming languages. We do not only know the framework very well 
				but we are also experts in programming and domain-specific language design. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in 
				contact with us (
