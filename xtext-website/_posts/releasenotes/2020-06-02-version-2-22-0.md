Xtext 2.22.0 is mainly a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).

## Documentation

The [Xtext community website](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/community.html) and the [Xtext documentation website](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/index.html) have been updated. New Xtext-based projects have been added, some editor features and the Unit testing / UI testing capabilities have been documented and the embedded code snippets have been updated as well.

We further enhanced the [Xtext Developer Documentation](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/tree/master/dev-doc) to enable the community to easily contribute to Xtext.

## Code Generation improvements
This release contains some fixes to improve the generated code in the `src-gen` folders. The following files are affected:

* `Internal<dslName>.g` file in the **runtime** module - [xtext-core#1467](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/1467)
* `Internal<dslName>Parser.java` file in the **runtime** module - [xtext-core#1467](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/1467)
* `<dslName>GrammarAccess.java` file in the **runtime** module - [xtext-core#269](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/269)
* `Partial<dslName>ContentAssistParser.java` file in the **ide** module - [xtext-core#1418](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/issues/1418)

We encourage you to regenerate your languages with the latest Xtext version. Usually you do not recognize any changes, unless you check-in the `src-gen` folders in a version control system.

## Eclipse Integration

## Upgrades

* Xtext 2.22 requires ASM 8.0.1 (updated from 7.2.0).
* Maven Tycho was updated to version 1.7.0.
* MWE(2) was updated to 2.11.3/1.5.3.

## Removals

* Xtext no longer has a direct dependency to ICU4J. If you use ICU4J in your codebase you should also consider to get rid of this dependencies as it will no longer be supported by Eclipse (Platform).
* As announced in the 2.21 Release the deprecated API in the LSP area was removed.
* We also removed the outdated leftovers of IDEA Support in `org.eclipse.xtext.xtext.generator`.

## Deprecations

* `IXtext2EcorePostProcessor` & `XtendXtext2EcorePostProcessor` & `ProjectAwareXtendXtext2EcorePostProcessor` were deprecated as they depend on old Xpand/Xtend(1). As already announced in the [2.21 release notes](2020-03-03-version-2-21-0.md) you should avoid depending on the old Xpand based `org.eclipse.xtext.generator` as well as on Xtend(1) based postprocessing. So if you have an `.ext` file right next to your `.xtext` file or subclass the interface it's about time to switch to a manually maintained Ecore model.
