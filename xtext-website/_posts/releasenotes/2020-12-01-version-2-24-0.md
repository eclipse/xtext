Xtext 2.24.0 is a maintenance release.

## Call to Action: Secure the future maintenance of Xtext

As you might have recognized, the number of people contributing to Xtext on a regular basis has declined over the past years and so has the number of contributions. At the same time the amount of work for basic maintenance has stayed the same or even increased with the new release cadence of Java and the Eclipse simultaneous release. Briefly: The future maintenance of Xtext is at risk. If you care, please join the discussion in [https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1721).


## Language Server Protocol

The Xtext Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation has now an experimental API for Quickfix code actions (have a look at the [`IQuickFixProvider`](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/blob/master/org.eclipse.xtext.ide/src/org/eclipse/xtext/ide/editor/quickfix/IQuickFixProvider.java) interface and [`QuickFixCodeActionService`](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-core/blob/master/org.eclipse.xtext.ide/src/org/eclipse/xtext/ide/server/codeActions/QuickFixCodeActionService.java) class).

## Upgrades

* Eclipse Platform and JDT Maven dependencies were updated to the 4.17 / Eclipse 2020-09 versions.
* MWE(2) was updated to 2.12.0/1.6.0.
