Xtext 2.21 is a maintenance release.

## License Change

In compliance with general requirements by the Eclipse Foundation the license for Xtext & Xtend has been changed to [EPL 2.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/).

## Documentation

The [Xtext community website](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/community.html) has been updated to list all the cool projects people are building around Xtext/Xtend.
The list is not yet complete, so feel free to contact us if you are also interested in listing your project there. 

## Eclipse Integration

## xtext-maven-plugin

### testGenerate Goal

The Maven plugin has now two goals, `generate` and `testGenerate`. The new `testGenerate` goal runs during the `generate-test-sources` phase and uses the test classpath of the maven project.

## Upgrades

* MWE(2) was updated to 2.11.2 / 1.5.2.
* Xtext 2.21 now requires EMF 2.20 as minimal required version.
* LSP4J is now on version 0.9.0 / Language Server Protocol version 3.15.

## Xtend

## Deprecations

* In `org.eclipse.xtext.ide` many of the LSP Services were changed in the protocol to use service specific parameters instead of `TextDocumentPositionParams`. We adapted the services to use the new parameter classes and marked the old ones as deprecated and to be removed with Xtext 2.22. If you have custom subclasses of the affected services please adapt your implementations.
* We again encourage you to get rid of the old generator as we might have to remove it in 2020-06 / Xtext 2.22 - see/join [Xtext Issue #1669](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext/issues/1669).
