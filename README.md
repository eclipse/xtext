# Eclipse Xtext Core Framework

This repository contains the platform-independent language framework of Xtext.

## How To Build

Check out and run `./gradlew build`.

Additional command line arguments:
 - `-PcompileXtend=true` activates the [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) compiler, but this is optional because the generated Java code is included in the repository.
 - `-PuseJenkinsSnapshots=true` switches to using the Maven repository generated by the [Jenkins build job](http://services.typefox.io/open-source/jenkins/job/xtext-lib/) for xtext-lib. Without this argument, [Sonatype snapshots](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots) are used.

## Continuos Integration

This project is built by the [xtext-core multi-branch job on Jenkins](http://services.typefox.io/open-source/jenkins/job/xtext-core/).
